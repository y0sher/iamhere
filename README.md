# iamhere
Report work presence from the command line. suitable for me and my teammates. might extend with plugins capability in the future.

# Why ?
I had trouble to remember reporting my presence every morning, this ended up with my boss posting a big note over my station : "Yosher, DID YOU REPORT TODAY?".
It helped for 3 days and I failed to report yet again.
So I wrote this small command line utility to make it easy and fun for me and my teammates to report from the command line.
I might expend it to work with other presence clocks in the future and schedule reports.

# Install 
```
yarn global add iamhere
```
or 
```
npm i -g iamhere
```

you will be promoted to input your phone number. the software will contact the servers to identify your details and save it to report every time.
